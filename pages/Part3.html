        <h4>The relational data model consists of the following three components</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Data structure</li>
            <li>Data manipulation</li>
            <li>Data integrity</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Relation</dt>
        <dd>
            A named two-dimensional table of data.
        </dd>
        <dt>Primary Key</dt>
        <dd>
            An attribute or a combination of attributes that uniquely identifies each row
            in a relation. (Primary key is underlined)
        </dd>
        <dt>Composite key</dt>
        <dd>
            A primary key that consists of more than one attribute.
        </dd>
        <dt>Foreign key</dt>
        <dd>
            An attribute in a relation that serves as the primary key of another relation
            in the same database.
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        <h4>Properties of Relations</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Each relation (or table) in a database has a unique name</li>
            <li>An entry at the intersection of each row and column is atomic (or single valued). 
                There can be only one value associated with each attribute on a specific row of a table; 
                no multivalued attributes are allowed in a relation</li>
            <li>Each row is unique; no two rows in a relation can be identical</li>
            <li>Each attribute (or column) within a table has a unique name</li>
            <li>The sequence of columns (left to right) is insignificant. The order of the columns in a 
                relation can be changed without changing the meaning or use of the relation</li>
            <li>The sequence of rows (top to bottom) is insignificant. As with columns, the order of the 
                rows of a relation may be changed or stored in any sequence.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Null</dt>
        <dd>
            A value that may be assigned to an attribute when no other value applies or when the
            appicable value is unknown.
        </dd>
        <dt>Entity integrity rule</dt>
        <dd>
            A rule that states that no primary key attribute (or component of a primary key attribute)
            may be null.
        </dd>
        <dt>Referential integtiy constraints</dt>
        <dd>
            A rule that states that either each foreign key value must match a primary key value in
            another relation or the foreign key value must be null.
        </dd>
        <dt>Well-structured relation</dt>
        <dd>
            A relation that contains minimal redundancy and allows users to insert, modify, and delete
            the rows in a table without errors or inconsistencies.
        </dd>
        <dt>Anomaly</dt>
        <dd>
            An error or inconsistency that may result when a user attempts to update a table that
            contains redundant data. The three types of anomalies are insertion, deletion, and
            modification anomalies.
        </dd>
        <dt>Surrogate primary key</dt>
        <dd>
            A serial number or other system-assigned primary key for a relation.
        </dd>
        <dt>Recusive foreign key</dt>
        <dd>
            A foreign key in a relation that references the primary key values of the same relation.
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <ol>
        <h4>Strategies to map supertype/subtype relationships</h4>
        <li>Create a separate relation for the supertype and for each of its subtypes</li>
        <li>Assign to the relation created for the supertype the attributes that are common to all 
            members of the supertype, including the primary key</li>
        <li>>Assign to the relation for each subtype the primary key of the supertype and only those 
            attributes that are unique to that subtype</li>
        <li>Assign one (or more) attributes of the supertype to function as the subtype discriminator. 
            (The role of the subtype discriminator was discussed in Chapter 3.)</li>
    </ol>

                primary key of relation for the relationship or associative entity the primary keys 
                from all related entities; with its own surrogate key, the primary keys of the associated 
                entities are included as foreign keys in the relation for the relationship or associative

                same primary key (with the same or local name) but with only the nonkey attributes related 
                to that subclass
