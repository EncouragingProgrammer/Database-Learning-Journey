    <p>
        <h4>The relational data model consists of the following three components</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Data structure</li>
            <li>Data manipulation</li>
            <li>Data integrity</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Relation</dt>
        <dd>
            A named two-dimensional table of data.
        </dd>
        <dt>Primary Key</dt>
        <dd>
            An attribute or a combination of attributes that uniquely identifies each row
            in a relation. (Primary key is underlined)
        </dd>
        <dt>Composite key</dt>
        <dd>
            A primary key that consists of more than one attribute.
        </dd>
        <dt>Foreign key</dt>
        <dd>
            An attribute in a relation that serves as the primary key of another relation
            in the same database.
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        <h4>Properties of Relations</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Each relation (or table) in a database has a unique name</li>
            <li>An entry at the intersection of each row and column is atomic (or single valued). 
                There can be only one value associated with each attribute on a specific row of a table; 
                no multivalued attributes are allowed in a relation</li>
            <li>Each row is unique; no two rows in a relation can be identical</li>
            <li>Each attribute (or column) within a table has a unique name</li>
            <li>The sequence of columns (left to right) is insignificant. The order of the columns in a 
                relation can be changed without changing the meaning or use of the relation</li>
            <li>The sequence of rows (top to bottom) is insignificant. As with columns, the order of the 
                rows of a relation may be changed or stored in any sequence.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Null</dt>
        <dd>
            A value that may be assigned to an attribute when no other value applies or when the
            appicable value is unknown.
        </dd>
        <dt>Entity integrity rule</dt>
        <dd>
            A rule that states that no primary key attribute (or component of a primary key attribute)
            may be null.
        </dd>
        <dt>Referential integtiy constraints</dt>
        <dd>
            A rule that states that either each foreign key value must match a primary key value in
            another relation or the foreign key value must be null.
        </dd>
        <dt>Well-structured relation</dt>
        <dd>
            A relation that contains minimal redundancy and allows users to insert, modify, and delete
            the rows in a table without errors or inconsistencies.
        </dd>
        <dt>Anomaly</dt>
        <dd>
            An error or inconsistency that may result when a user attempts to update a table that
            contains redundant data. The three types of anomalies are insertion, deletion, and
            modification anomalies.
        </dd>
        <dt>Surrogate primary key</dt>
        <dd>
            A serial number or other system-assigned primary key for a relation.
        </dd>
    </dl>
