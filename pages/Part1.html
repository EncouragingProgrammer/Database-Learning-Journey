	<h2>Unit 1 Section 1: File Processing Systems</h2>

	<p>
		Wikipedia defines a <dfn>database</dfn> as " an organized collection of data stored 
		and accessed electronically. Small databases can be stored on a file system, while 
		large databases are hosted on computer clusters or cloud storage."

		<dd>
			An organized collection of logically related data. 
		</dd>

		<dd>
			Stored representation of objects and events that have meaning and importance 
			in the user's environment.
		</dd>
		<dt>Information</dt>
		<dd>
			Data that have been processed in such a way as to increase the knowledge of 
			the person who uses the data.
		</dd>
		<dt>Metadata</dt>
		<dd>
			Data that describes the properties or characteristics of end-user data and
			the context of those data.
		</dd>
	</dl>

		<h4>Disadvantages of traditional file processing systems</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Program-data dependence</li>
			<li>Duplication of data</li>

			<li>Excessive program maintenance</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<dl>
		<dt>Database applicaton</dt>
		<dd>
			An application program (or set of related programs) that is used to perform a series
			of database activities (create, read, update and delete) on behalf of database users.
		</dd>
	</dl>

	<h2>Unit 1 Section 2: Database Management Systems</h2>

	<dl>
		<dt>Data model</dt>
		<dd>
			Graphical systems used to capture the nature and relationships among data.
		</dd>
		<dt>Entity</dt>
		<dd>
			A person, a place, an object, an event, or a concept in the user environment about
			which the organization wishes to maintain data.
		</dd>
		<dt>Relational database</dt>
		<dd>
			A database that represents data as a collection of tables in which all data relationships
			are represented by common values in related tables.
		</dd>
		<dt>Database management system (DBMS)</dt>
		<dd>
			A software system that is used to create, maintain, and provide controlled access to 
			user databases.
		</dd>
	</dl>

	<p>
		<h4>Advantages of the Database Approach</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Program-data independence</li>
			<li>Planned data redundancy</li>
			<li>Improved data consistency</li>
			<li>Improved data sharing</li>
			<li>Increased productivity of application development</li>
			<li>Enforcement of standards</li>
			<li>Improved data quality</li>
			<li>Improved data accessibility and responsiveness</li>
			<li>Reduced program maintenance</li>
			<li>Improved dexision support</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<dl>
		<dt>Data independence</dt>
		<dd>
			The separation of data descriptions from the application programs that use the data.
		</dd>
		<dt>User view</dt>
		<dd>
			A logical description of some portion of teh database that is required by a user to
			perform some task.
		</dd>
		<dt>Constraint</dt>
		<dd>
			A rule that cannot be violated by database users.
		</dd>
	</dl>

	<p>
		<h4>Costs and Risks of the Database Approach</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>New, specialized personnel</li>
			<li>Installation and management costs and complexity</li>
			<li>Conversion costs</li>
			<li>Need for explicit backup and recovery</li>
			<li>Organizational conflict</li>
		</ul>

	<dl>
		<dt>Computer-aided software engineering (CASE) tools</dt>
		<dd>
			Software tools that provide automated support for some portion of the 
			systems development process.
		</dd>
		<dt>Repository</dt>
		<dd>
			A centralized knowledge base of all data definitions, data relationships,
			screen and report formats, and other system conponents.
		</dd>
		<dt>Enterprise resource planning (ERP)</dt>
		<dd>
			A business management system that integrates all functions of the enterprise,
			such as manufacturing, sales, finance, marketing, inventory, accounting, and
			human resources. ERP systems are software applications that provide the data
			necessary for the enterprise to examine and manage its activities.
		</dd>
		<dt>Data warehouse</dt>
		<dd>
			An integrated decision support database whose content is derived from the various
			operational databases.
		</dd>
