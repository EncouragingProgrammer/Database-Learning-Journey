        <dt>Data warehouse</dt>
        <dd>
            A subject-oriented, integrated, time-variant, nonupdatable collection of data used in support
            of management decision-making processes.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <em>Subject-oriented</em>> A data warejpise is organized around the key subjects (or 
                    high-level entities) of the enterprise. Major subjects may include customers, patients, 
                    students, products, and time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>Integrated</em> The data housed in the data warehouse are defined using consistent
                    naming conventions, formats, encoding structures, and related characteristics gathered
                    from several internal systems of record and also often from sources external to the
                    organization. This means that the data warehouse holds the one version of "the truth."

                <li>
                    <em>Time-variant</em> Data in the data warehouse contain a time dimension so that they 
                    may be used to study trends and changes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>nonupdatable</em> Data in the data warehouse are loaded and refreshed from operational
                    systems, but cannot be updated by end users.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <dt>Operational system</dt>
        <dd>
            A system that is used to run a business in real-time, based on current data. Also called a system
