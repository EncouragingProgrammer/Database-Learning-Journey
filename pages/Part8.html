            that have been changed are applied to the database, and the database is returned to

            have been aborted, or terminated abnormally.
        </dd>
        <dt>Forward recovery</dt>
        <dd>
            A technique that starts with an earlier copy of a database. After images (the results

        <dt>Database destruction</dt>
        <dd>
            The database itself is lost, destroyed, or cannot be read.
        </dd>
        <dt>Concurrency control</dt>
        <dd>
            The process of managing simultaneous operations against a database so that
            data integrity is maintained and the operations do not interfere with each
            other in a multiuser environment.
        </dd>
        <dt>Inconsistent read problem</dt>
        <dd>
            An unrepeatable read, one that occurs when one user reads data that have been
            partially updated by another user.
        </dd>
        <dt>Locking</dt>
        <dd>
            A process in which any data that are retrieved by a user for updating must
            be locked, or denied to other users, until the update is completed or aborted.
        </dd>
        <dt>Locking level (lock granularity)</dt>
        <dd>
            The extent of a database resource that is included with each lock. Locking
            levels include:
            <ul>
                <li>Database</li>
                <li>Table</li>
                <li>Block or page</li>
                <li>Record</li>
                <li>Field</li>
            </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt>Shared locks (S locks, or read locks)</dt>
        <dd>
            A technique that allows other transactions to read but not update a record
            or another resource.
        </dd>
        <dt>Exclusive locks (X lock, or write lock)</dt>
        <dd>
            A technique that prevents another transaction from reading and therefore
            updating a record until it is unlocked.
        </dd>
        <dt>Deadlock</dt>
        <dd>
            An impasse that results when two or more transactions have locked a common
            resource, and each waits for the other to unlock that resource.
        </dd>
        <dt>Deadlock prevention</dt>
        <dd>
            A method for resolving deadlocks in which user programs must lock all records
            they require at the beginning of a transaction (rather than one at a time).
        </dd>
        <dt>Two-phase locking protocol</dt>
        <dd>
            A procedure for acquiring the necessary locks for a transaction in which all
            necessary locks are acquired before any locks are released, resulting in a
            growing phase when locks are acquired and a shrinking phase when they are
            released.
        </dd>
        <dt>Deadlock resolution</dt>
        <dd>
            An approach to dealing with deadlocks that allows deadlocks to occur but builds
            mechanisms into the DBMS for detecting and breaking the deadlocks.
        </dd>
        <dt>Versioning</dt>
        <dd>
            An approach to concurrency control in which each transaction is restricted to
            a view of the database as of the time that transaction stared, and when a
            transaction modifies a record, the DBMS creates a new record version instead
            of overwriting the old record. Hence, no form of locking is required.
        </dd>
        <dt>Data dictionary</dt>
        <dd>
            A repository of information about a database that documents data elements of
            a database.
        </dd>
        <dt>System catalog</dt>
        <dd>
            A system-created database that describes all database objects, including data
            dictionary information, and also includes user access information.
        </dd>
        <dt>Information repository</dt>
        <dd>
            A component that stores metadata that describe an organization's data and
            data processing resources, manages the total information processing environment,
            and combines information about an organization's business information and its
            application portfolio. 
        </dd>
        <dt>Information Resource Dictionary System (IRDS)</dt>
        <dd>
            A computer software tool that is used to manage and control access to the 
            information repository. Repository engine supports five core functions:
            <ol>
                <li>Object management</li>
                <li>Reloatinship management</li>
                <li>Dynamic extensibility</li>
                <li>Version management</li>
                <li>Configuration management</li>
            </ol>
        </dd>
        <dt>Data archiving</dt>
        <dd>
            The process of moving inactive data to another storage location where it can be
            access when needed. 
        </dd>
        <dt>Heartbeat query</dt>
        <dd>
            A query submitted by a DBA to test the current performance of a database or to
            predict the response time for queries that have promised response times. Also
            called a canary query.
        </dd>
