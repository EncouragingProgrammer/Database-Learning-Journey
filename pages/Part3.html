    <p>
        <h4>The relational data model consists of the following three components</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Data structure</li>
            <li>Data manipulation</li>
            <li>Data integrity</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Relation</dt>
        <dd>
            A named two-dimensional table of data.
        </dd>
        <dt>Primary Key</dt>
        <dd>
            An attribute or a combination of attributes that uniquely identifies each row
            in a relation. (Primary key is underlined)
        </dd>
        <dt>Composite key</dt>
        <dd>
            A primary key that consists of more than one attribute.
        </dd>
        <dt>Foreign key</dt>
        <dd>
            An attribute in a relation that serves as the primary key of another relation
            in the same database.
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        <h4>Properties of Relations</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Each relation (or table) in a database has a unique name</li>
            <li>An entry at the intersection of each row and column is atomic (or single valued). 
                There can be only one value associated with each attribute on a specific row of a table; 
                no multivalued attributes are allowed in a relation</li>
            <li>Each row is unique; no two rows in a relation can be identical</li>
            <li>Each attribute (or column) within a table has a unique name</li>
            <li>The sequence of columns (left to right) is insignificant. The order of the columns in a 
                relation can be changed without changing the meaning or use of the relation</li>
            <li>The sequence of rows (top to bottom) is insignificant. As with columns, the order of the 
                rows of a relation may be changed or stored in any sequence.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Null</dt>
        <dd>
            A value that may be assigned to an attribute when no other value applies or when the
            appicable value is unknown.
        </dd>
        <dt>Entity integrity rule</dt>
        <dd>
            A rule that states that no primary key attribute (or component of a primary key attribute)
            may be null.
        </dd>
        <dt>Referential integtiy constraints</dt>
        <dd>
            A rule that states that either each foreign key value must match a primary key value in
            another relation or the foreign key value must be null.
        </dd>
        <dt>Well-structured relation</dt>
        <dd>
            A relation that contains minimal redundancy and allows users to insert, modify, and delete
            the rows in a table without errors or inconsistencies.
        </dd>
        <dt>Anomaly</dt>
        <dd>
            An error or inconsistency that may result when a user attempts to update a table that
            contains redundant data. The three types of anomalies are insertion, deletion, and
            modification anomalies.
        </dd>
        <dt>Surrogate primary key</dt>
        <dd>
            A serial number or other system-assigned primary key for a relation.
        </dd>
        <dt>Recusive foreign key</dt>
        <dd>
            A foreign key in a relation that references the primary key values of the same relation.
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <ol>
        <h4>Strategies to map supertype/subtype relationships</h4>
        <li>Create a separate relation for the supertype and for each of its subtypes</li>
        <li>Assign to the relation created for the supertype the attributes that are common to all 
            members of the supertype, including the primary key</li>
        <li>>Assign to the relation for each subtype the primary key of the supertype and only those 
            attributes that are unique to that subtype</li>
        <li>Assign one (or more) attributes of the supertype to function as the subtype discriminator. 
            (The role of the subtype discriminator was discussed in Chapter 3.)</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Unit 3 Section 2: Normalization</h2>

    <dl>
        <dt>Normalization</dt>
        <dd>
            The process of decomposing relations with anomalies to produce smaller, well-structured 
            relations.
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <h4>Main goals of Normalization</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Minimize data redundancy, thereby avoiding anomalies and conserving storage space</li>
        <li>Simplify the enforcement of referential integrity constraints</li>
        <li>Make it easier to maintain data (insert, update, and delete)</li>
        <li>
            Provide a better design that is an improved Representation of the real world and a
            stronger basis for future growth.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <dl>
        <dt>Normal form</dt>
        <dd>
            A state f a relation that requires that certain rules regarding relationships between
            attributes (or functional dependencies) are satisfied.
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <h4>Normalization Rules</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>First normal form </strong>
            - Any multivalued attributes (also called repeating groups) have been removed, so there
            is a single value (possibly null) at the intersection of each row and collumn of the
            table.    
        </li>
        <li><strong>Second normal form </strong>
            - Any partial functional dependencies have been removed (ie., nonkey attributes are
            identified by the whole primary key).
        </li>
        <li><strong>Third normal form </strong>
            - Any transitive dependencies have been removed (ie., nonkey attributes are identified
            by only the primary key)
        </li>
        <li><strong>Boyce-Codd normal form </strong>
            - Any remaining anomalies that result from functional dependencies have been removed
            (because there was more than one possible primary key for the same nonkeys).
        </li>
        <li><strong>Fourth normal form </strong>
            - Any multivalued dependencies have been removed.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Fifth normal form </strong>
            - Any remaining anomalies have been removed.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <dl>
        <dt>Functional dependency</dt>
        <dd>
            A constraint between two attributes in which the value of one attribute is determined
            by the value of another attribute.
        </dd>
        <dt>Determinant</dt>
        <dd>
            The attribute on the left side of the arrow in a functional dependency.
        </dd>
        <dt>Candidate key</dt>
        <dd>
            An attribute, or combination of attributes, that uniquely identifies a row in a 
            relation. 
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <h4>A candidate key must satisfy the following properties:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Unique identification </strong>
            - For every row, the value of the key must uniquely identify that row. 
            This property implies that each nonkey attribute is functionally 
            dependent on that key.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Nonredundancy</strong>
            - No attribute in the key can be deleted without destroying the property
            of uniqye identification.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <dl>
        <dt>First normal form (1NF)</dt>
        <dd>
            A relation that has a primary key and in which there are no repeating groups.
        </dd>
        <dt>Second normal form (2NF)</dt>
        <dd>
            A relation in first normal form in which every nonkey attribute is fully
            functionally dependent on the primary key. 
        </dd>
        <dt>Partial functional dependency</dt>
        <dd>
            A functional dependency in which one or more nonkey attributes are functionally
            dependent on part (but not all) of the primary key.
        </dd>
        <dt>Third normal form (3NF)</dt>
        <dd>
            A relation that is in second normal orm and has no transitive dependencies.
        </dd>
        <dt>Transitive deendency</dt>
        <dd>
            A functional dependency between the primary key and one or more nonkey
            attributes that are dependent on the primary key via another nonkey attribute.
        </dd>
        <dt>Boyce-Codd normal form (BCNF)</dt>
        <dd>
            A normal form of a relation in which every determinant is a candidate key.
        </dd>
        <dt>Multivalued dependency</dt>
        <dd>
            The type of dependency that exists when there are at least three attributes
            (e.g., A, B, and C) in a relation, with a well-defined set of B and C values
            for each A value, but those B and C values are independent of each other.
        </dd>
        <dt>Fourth normal form (4NF)</dt>
        <dd>
            A normal form of a relation in which the relation is in BCNF and contains no
            multivalued dependencies.
        </dd>
        <dt>Synonyms</dt>
        <dd>
            Two (or more) attributes that have different names but the same meaning.
        </dd>
        <dt>Alias</dt>
        <dd>
            An alternative name used for an attribute.
        </dd>
        <dt>Homonyms</dt>
        <dd>
            An attribute that may have more than one meaning.
        </dd>
        <dt>Enterprise key</dt>
