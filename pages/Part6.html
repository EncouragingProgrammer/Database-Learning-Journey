    <dl>
        <dt>Client/server systems</dt>
        <dd>
            A networked computing model that distributes processes between clients and servers, 
            which supply the requested services. In a database system, th database generally resides
            on a server that processes the DBMS. The clients may process the application systems or
            request services from another server that holds the application program.
        </dd>
        <dt>Application partitioning</dt>
        <dd>
            The process of assigning portions of the application code to client or server partitions
            after it is written to achieve better performance and interoperability (ability of a
            component to function on different platforms).
        </dd>
        <dt>Fat client</dt>
        <dd>
            A client PC that is responsible for processing presentation logic, extensive application 
            and business rules logic, and many DBMS functions.
        </dd>
        <dt>Database server</dt>
        <dd>
            A computer that is responsible for database storage, access, and processing in a client/server
            environment. Some people also use this term to describe a two-tier client/server application.
        </dd>
        <dt>Middleware</dt>
        <dd>
            Software that allows an application to interoperate with other software without requiring
            the user to understand and code the low-level operations necessary to achieve interoperability.
        </dd>
        <dt>Application program interface (API)</dt>
        <dd>
            Sets of routines that an application program uses to direct the performance of procedures
            by the computer's operating system.
        </dd>
        <dt>Open database connectivitiy (OBDC)</dt>
        <dd>
            An application programming interface that provides a common language for application programs
            to access and process SQL databases independent of the particular DBMS that is accessed.
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <h4>Basic steps for accessing a database:</h4>

        <li>Process the results of the query.</li>
        <li>Repeat steps 3-4 as necessary.</li>
        <li>Close the connection to the database.</li>
    </ol>

        <dt>Three-tier architecture</dt>
        <dd>
            A client/server configuration that includes three layers: a client layer and
            two server layers. Although the nature of the server layers differs, a common
            configuration contains an application server and a database server.
        </dd>
        <dt>Thin client</dt>
        <dd>
            An application where the client (PC) accessing the application primarily
            provides the user interfaces and some application processing, usually with
            no or limited data storage.
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <h4>Web Application Components</h4>
    <ol>
