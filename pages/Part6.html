        <dt>Client/server systems</dt>
        <dd>
            A networked computing model that distributes processes between clients and servers, 
            which supply the requested services. In a database system, th database generally resides
            on a server that processes the DBMS. The clients may process the application systems or
            request services from another server that holds the application program.

        <dt>Application partitioning</dt>
        <dd>
            The process of assigning portions of the application code to client or server partitions
            after it is written to achieve better performance and interoperability (ability of a
            component to function on different platforms).
