        <h3>Supplemental SQL / Database courses</h3>
        <p>
            I highly recommend the following LinkedIn Learning courses:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/sql-essential-training-3/">
                    LinkedIn Learning Course - SQL Essential Training</a> by <a href="https://bw.org/">Bill Weinmann</a>
                <p>
                    This courses focuses on the SQL language and is very beneficial for supplementing this chapter
                    of the textbook.

                <p>
                    This course demonstrates using Microsoft SQL Server and PostgreSQL through docker containers,
                    and the Azure Data Studio RDBMS.

    <dl>
        <dt>Relational DBMS</dt>
        <dd>
            A database management system that manages data as a collection of tables in which all
            data relationships are represented by common values in related tables.
        </dd>
        <dt>Catalog</dt>
        <dd>
            A set of schemas that, when put together, contitutes a description of a database.
        </dd>
        <dt>Schema</dt>
        <dd>
            A structure that contains descripions of objects created by a user, such as base tables,
            views, and constraints, as part of a database.
        </dd>
        <dt>data definition language (DDL)</dt>
        <dd>
            Commands used to define a database, including those for creating, altering, and dropping
            tables and established constraints.
        </dd>
        <dt>data manipulation language (DML)</dt>
        <dd>
            Commands used to maintain and query a database, including those for updating, inserting,
            modifying and querying data.
        </dd>
        <dt>Data control language (DCL)</dt>
        <dd>
            Commands used to control a database, including those for administering privileges and
            committing (saving) data.
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        Basic syntax for creating a database using SQL is:
        <pre><code>
            CREATE SCHEMA database_name; AUTHORIZATION owner_user id
        </code></pre>
    </p>

    <h4 class="center">SQL DDL CREATE Commands:</h4>
    <table class="center">
        <tr>
            <td>CREATE SCHEMA</td>
            <td>
                Used to define the portion of a database that a particular user owns. Schemas are 
                dependent on a catalog and contain schema objects, including base tables and views, 
                domains, constraints, assertions, character sets, collations, and so forth.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>CREATE TABLE</td>
            <td>
                Defines a new table and its columns. The table may be a base table or a derived table. 
                Tables are dependent on a schema. Derived tables are created by executing a query that 
                uses one or more tables or views.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>CREATE VIEW</td>
            <td>
                Defines a logical table from one or more tables or views. Views may not be indexed. 
                There are limitations on updating data through a view. Where views can be updated, 
                those changes can be transferred to the underlying base tables originally referenced 
                to create the view.
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    
    <h2>Unit 5 Section 2: SQL as a Data Maninpulation Language (DML)</h2>

    <p>
        SQL Inserting into a table:
        <pre><code>
            INSERT INTO Customer_T VALUES
            ('Friendship Castle', '123 Unicorn Road', 'FriendshipVille', 'FN', 12345);
        </code></pre>

    <p>
        SQL Deteling rows from a table:
        <pre><code>
            DELETE FROM Customer_T
            WHERE CustomerState = 'FN';
        </code></pre>
        <p>
            Note: it is wise to verify with SELECT rows you intend to delete, and check that only desired rows
            are icluded.
        </p>
    </p>

    <p>
        SQL Update:
        <pre><code>
            UPDATE Product_T
            SET ProductStandardPrice = 700
                WHERE ProductID = 7;
        </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        SQL Create Index:
        <pre><code>
            CREATE INDEX Name_IDX ON Customer_T (CustomerName);
        </code></pre>
        SQL Drop Index: 
        <pre><code>
            DROP INDEX Name_IDX;
        </code></pre>

            <td>
                Lists the columns (including expressions involving columns) from base tables, derived tables, 
                or views to be projected into the table that will be the result of the command. (That’s the 
                technical way of saying it lists the data you want to display.)

                Includes the conditions for row selection within the items in the FROM clause and the conditions 
                between tables, derived tables, or views for joining. Because SQL is considered a set manipulation 
                language, the WHERE clause is important in defining the set of rows being manipulated.

    <dl>
        <dt>Base table</dt>
        <dd>
            A table in the relational data model containing the inserted raw data. Base tables
            correspond to the relations that are identified in the database's conceptual
            schema.
        </dd>
        <dt>Virtual table</dt>
        <dd>
            A table constructed automatically as needed by a DBMS. Virtual tables are not
            maintained as real data.
        </dd>
        <dt>Dynamic view</dt>
        <dd>
            A virtual table that is created dynamically upon request by a user. A dynamic view
            is not a temporary table. Rather, its definition is stored in the system catalog,
            and the contents of the view are materialized as a result of an SQL query that uses
            the view. It differs from a materialized view, which may be stored on a disc and 
            refreshed at intervals or when used, depending on the RDBMS.
        </dd>
        <dt>Materialized view</dt>
        <dd>
            Copies or replicas of data, based on SQL queries created in the same manner as
            dynamic views. However, a materialized view exits as a table and thus care must be
            taken to keep it synchronized with its associated base tables.

        <dd>

                Executes different sets of SQL sequences, according to a comparison of values or the value 
                of a WHEN clause, using either search conditions or value expressions. The logic is similar 
                to that of an SQL CASE expression, but it ends with END CASE rather than END and has no 
                equivalent to the ELSE NULL clause.

            <td>
                If a predicate is TRUE, executes an SQL statement. The statement ends with an ENDIF and 
                contains ELSE and ELSEIF statements to manage flow control for different conditions.

        <dd>
            A named set of SQL statements that are considered (triggered) when a data modification (i.e., 
            INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) occurs or if certain data definitions are encountered. If a condition
            stated within a trigger is met, then a prescribed action is taken.

        <strong>Trigger example</strong>
        <pre><code>
