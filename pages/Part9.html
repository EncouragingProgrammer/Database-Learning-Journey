	<h2>Unit 9 Section 1: Object-Oriented Data Modeling</h2>

    <dl>
        <dt>Class</dt>
        <dd>
            An entity that has a well-defined role in the application domain about which the
            organization wishes to maintain state, behavior, and identity.
        </dd>
        <dt>Object</dt>
        <dd>
            An instance of a class that encapsulates data and behavior.
        </dd>
        <dt>State</dt>
        <dd>
            An object's properties (attributes and relationships) and the values those properties
            have.
        </dd>
        <dt>Behavior</dt>
        <dd>
            The way in which an object acts and reacts.
        </dd>
        <dt>Class diagram</dt>
        <dd>
            A diagram that shows the static structure of an object-oriented model: the object
            classes, their internal structure, and the relationships in which they participate.
        </dd>
        <dt>Operation</dt>
        <dd>
            A function or a service that is provided by all the instances of a class.
        </dd>
        <dt>Encapsulation</dt>
        <dd>
            The technique of hiding the implementation details of an object from its external
            view.
        </dd>
        <dt>Association</dt>
        <dd>
            A named relationship between or among object classes.
        </dd>
        <dt>Association role</dt>
        <dd>
            The end of an association, where it connects to a class.
        </dd>
        <dt>Multiplicity</dt>
        <dd>
            A specification that indicates how many objects participate in a given relationship.
        </dd>
        <dt>Association class</dt>
        <dd>
            An association that has attributes or operations of its own or that participates in
            relationships with other classes.
        </dd>
        <dt>Abstract class</dt>
        <dd>
            A class that has no direct instances but whose descendants may have direct instances.
        </dd>
        <dt>Concrete class</dt>
        <dd>
            A class that can have direct instances.
        </dd>
        <dt>Class-scope attribute</dt>
        <dd>
            An attribute of a class that specifies a value common to an entire class rather than
            a specific value for an instance.
        </dd>
        <dt>Polymorphism</dt>
        <dd>
            The ability of an operation with the same name to respond in different ways depending
            on the class context.
        </dd>
        <dt>Aggregation</dt>
        <dd>
            A part-of relationship between a component object and an aggregate object.
        </dd>
        <dt>Composition</dt>
        <dd>
            A part-of relationship in which parts belong to only one whole object and live and die
            with the whole object.
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>Unit 9 Section 2: Implementing Object Persistence using Relational Databases</h2>

    <dl>
        <dt>Persistence</dt>
        <dd>
            An object's capability to maintain its state between application execution sessions.
        </dd>
        <dt>Object-relational impedance mismatch</dt>
        <dd>
            The conceptual differences between the object-oriented appraoch to application design
            and the relational model for database design and implementation.
        </dd>
        <dt>Call-level application programming interface (API)</dt>
        <dd>
            A mechanism that provides an application program with access to an external service,
            such as a database management system.
        </dd>
        <dt>Object-relational mapping (ORM)</dt>
        <dd>
            Definition of structural relationship between object-oriented and relational 
            representations of data, typically to enable the use of a relational database to 
            provide persistence for objects.
        </dd>
        <dt>Declarative mapping schema</dt>
        <dd>
            A structure that defines the relationships between domain classes in the object-oriented
            model and relations in the relational model.
        </dd>
        <dt>N+1 selects problem</dt>
        <dd>
            A performance problem caused by too many SELECT statements generated by an ORM framework.
        </dd>
        <dt>Fetching strategy</dt>
        <dd>
            A model for specifying when and how an ORM framework retrieves persistent object to the
            run-time memory during a navigation process.
        </dd>
    </dl>
