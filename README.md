# Database-Learning-Journey
My journey learning about databases!

I am currently taking the course "Comp 378 - Introduction to Database Management" through Athabasca University and I wanted to challenge myself to document my learning journey through a simple website. I will be supplementing my learning through various LinkedIn Learning courses as well.

Hope you find this helpful!
