    <dl>
        <dt>Business rule</dt>
        <dd>
            A statement that defines or constrains some aspect of the business. It is intended
            to assert business structure or to control or influence the behavior of the business.
        </dd>

		<tr>
			<th>Characteristic</th>
			<th>Explanation</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Declarative</td>
			<td>
                A business rule is a statement of policy, not how policy is enforced or conducted;
                the rule does not describe a process or implementation, but rather describes what a
                process validates.
            </td>
		</tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Precise</td>
            <td>
                With the related organization, the rule must have only one interpretation among all
                interested people, and its meaning must be clear.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Atomic</td>
            <td>
                A business rule marks one statement, not several; no part of the rule can stand on
                its own as a rule (that is, the rule is indivisible, yet sufficient).
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Consistent</td>
            <td>
                A business rule must be internally consistent (that is, not contain conflicting
                statements) and must be consistent with (and not contradict) other rules.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Expressible</td>
            <td>
                A business rule must be able to be stated in natural language, but it will be stated
                in a structured natural language so that there is no misinterpretation.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Distinct</td>
            <td>
                Business rules are not redundant, but a business rule may refer to other rules 
                (especially to definitions).
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Business-oriented</td>
            <td>
                A business rule is stated in terms businesspeople can understand, and because it is a
                statement of business policy, only businesspeople can modify or invalidate a rule;
                thus, a business rule is owned by the business.
